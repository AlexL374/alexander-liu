## Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website that I developed for myself to be able to keep track of all of my experiences and watch my personal development.

So far I haven't been able to include any super fancy pieces on the website, I just wanted to get something out to share myself with the world :)

## For me
For myself in the future, if I want to redeploy an updated version, I should go to my git bash terminal and run the command 'npm run deploy'
